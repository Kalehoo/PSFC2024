<h1>PSFC2024</h1>
<h5>Personel Service For Coders / My thesis for spring 2024 (Savo Vocational College)</h5>


<h2>Project in nutshell</h2>

<p>PSFC2024 is a thesis project which main goals is to improve practical skills aswell as demonstrate ability for wide-spectrum web application developement.</p>

<h2>Plan:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b><u>Platform and solution</b></u>
    <p>PSFC2024 will be built on LNMPA, or Kali Linux (VM, Virtualbox) using Nginx as a server-, MySql as a database- and Angular as a coding solution. On frontend design plan is to use SASS-customized Bootstrap 5.2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><u>Functionality / What does PSFC2024 do?</b></u>
    <p>PSFC2024 is planned to work as a website where different developers and employers are seeking from short- to long-term contract of employment. Employers registered on site are able to hire developers or offer training packages fitted to their needs to study. By either successfully completing tasked workhours or provided training packages developers get virtual points increasing their overall ranking. Employers get their rating through feedback, which will be moderated by admins. </p>
  </li>
    <li>
      <b><u>Challenges</b></u>
      <p>There will be many challenges included into developement. Few of them listed here</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Security. While plan is to build basic means to prevent DDoS, several levels of injection, data breach etc involving all the neccessary measures from begin will be challenging. </li>
        <li>UX and responsiveness. User experience aside performance is one of most important aspects to keep users not trading your service to competitors. Needs good planning and noticing in timetable considering amount of work. Bootstrap 5 will help a lot with responsiveness thanks to it's gridsystem, but still (for example) things like Y-. X resolution flip and scale needs good pre-planning and coding.</li>
        <li>Scalability. Service needs to have potential to grow. Especially database needs to be constructed keeping eye of that possibility. </li>
        <li>Performance. Will need optimized as possible code from beginning and well plant infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Deadline. Especially considering new tools. Angular is not rocket science, but it has steeper learning curve than PHP what used in last major project, there where Nginx has several differencies (what have understood) compared to Apache.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
